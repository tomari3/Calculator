# Calculator project.

    This project takes me to the end of The Odin Project's 'Foundations' series.
    It will show my ability to code computational functions, handle events,
    show thought process, document my code and style the project.

    # Problem
    Make computational functions to interact with user inputs as operands.
    Visualize the process to the user. Keep record of past calculation and
    the ability to delete them. Track Error and display them accordantly,
    do not break on error.

    # Obstacle possibilities
    1. Parentheses function of inclosing two operand
    separate from the others.
    ?. Before researching I assume this can be solved if the input
    will be saved as variable and sent to execution as is by the JS, letting the compiler
    do the hard work.



    # Plan
    1. Set and check all compute functions
        -- functions --
        Add
        Subtract
        Multiply
        Divide
        Percentage
        Parenthesis
        Factorial
        Power*2
        Power*3
        Power*num
        power of power
        Root
        Pie
        Dot (float)
        Equal
        Backspace
        AC

    2. Set numbers
    3. Set input/output area
    4. mouse & keyboard functionality
    5. take input and make calculation
    6. return output as main and input as secondary
    7. TEST!
